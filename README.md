# Temperature-and-humidity-control-for-server-room-with-RFID-door-lock-esp32-blynk-ArduinoUNO-


For my last evaluation assignment I was given the assignment to make an Arduino circuit with 1 controller 1 sensor and 1 output.
I wanted to work with the RFID so I thought about what I would make and then I thought about a server room where I worked during my internship in the army. So I'm going to make a temperature and humidity control for a server room.

I wanted to make this project with the esp32 because this controller is easy to connect to blynk. But since I have errors to compile with my libraries I will make the hardware with the Arduino uno but I will make and explain both codes for the esp32 and Arduino uno.Since I use the Arduino uno for my hardware I will not be able to use blynk because I don't have wifi on my Arduino uno. That is why I make 2 codes 1 for the Arduino uno and 1 for the esp32 with which you can control the hardware from blynk (phone).


Necessities :
- Battery 9V ( can also be 12V battery or just a supply)
- Servo
- Ventilator
- Leds
- DHT11
- OLED
- RFID sensor
- Arduino uno ( or esp32)
- 4x Resistor 220ohm
- 1x resistor 3.2K
- Freewheeling diode
- Transistor BC547 ( can also be BC548 , ...)
- jumpwires
